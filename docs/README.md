## Getting Started

It's recommended that you use a dependency management tool such as [Dep](https://github.com/golang/dep). If you are using Dep you can import helix by running:

```bash
dep ensure -add github.com/nicklaw5/helix
```

Or you can simply import using the Go toolchain:

```bash
go get -u github.com/nicklaw5/helix
```

## Creating A New API Client

The only requirement for creating a new API client is your Twitch Client-ID. See the [Twitch authentication docs](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/authentication) on how to obtain a Client-ID. Once you have a Client-ID, to create a new client simply the `NewClient` function. passing through your client ID as an option. For example:

```go
client, err := helix.NewClient(&helix.Options{
    ClientID: "your-client-id",
})
if err != nil {
    // handle error
}
```

If you'd like to pass in your own `http.Client`, you can do so like this:

```go
httpClient := &http.Client{
    Transport: &http.Transport{
        MaxIdleConns:       10,
        IdleConnTimeout:    30 * time.Second,
    },
    Timeout: 10 * time.Second,
}

client, err := helix.NewClient(&helix.Options{
    ClientID:   "your-client-id",
    HTTPClient: httpClient,
})
if err != nil {
    // handle error
}
```

## Options

Below is a list of all available options that can be passed in when creating a new client:

```go
type Options struct {
    ClientID        string            // Required
    ClientSecret    string            // Default: empty string
    AppAccessToken  string            // Default: empty string
    UserAccessToken string            // Default: empty string
    UserAgent       string            // Default: empty string
    RedirectURI     string            // Default: empty string
    Scopes          []string          // Default: empty string slice
    HTTPClient      HTTPClient        // Default: http.DefaultClient
    RateLimitFunc   RateLimitFunc     // Default: nil
}
```

If no custom `http.Client` is provided, `http.DefaultClient` is used by default.

## Responses

It is common for a Twitch API request to simply fail sometimes. Occasionally a request gets hung up and eventually fails with a 500 internal server error. It's also possible that an invalid request was sent and Twitch responded with an error. To assist in circumstances such as these, the HTTP status code is returned with each API request, along with any error that may been encountered. For example, notice below that the `UsersResponse` struct, which is returned with the `GetUsers()` method, includes fields from the `ResponseCommon` struct.

```go
type UsersResponse struct {
    ResponseCommon
    Data ManyUsers
}

type ManyUsers struct {
    Users []User `json:"data"`
}

type ResponseCommon struct {
    StatusCode   int
    Header       http.Header
    Error        string `json:"error"`
    ErrorStatus  int    `json:"status"`
    ErrorMessage string `json:"message"`
}
```

Also note from above that the `ResponseCommon` struct includes the header results returned with each request.

## Request Rate Limiting

Twitch enforces strict request rate limits for their API. See [their documentation](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/api#rate-limits) for the specific rate limit values. At the time of writing this, requests are limited to 30 queries per minute (if a Bearer token is not provided) or 120 queries per minute (if a Bearer token is provided).

There are a number of helper methods on the response object for retrieving rate limit headers are integers. These include:

- `Response.GetRateLimit()`
- `Response.GetRateLimitRemaining()`
- `Response.GetRateLimitReset()`
- `Response.GetClipsCreationRateLimit()` (only available when called `client.CreateClip()`)
- `Response.GetClipsCreationRateLimitRemaining()` (only available when called `client.CreateClip()`)
- `Response.GetStreamsMetadataRateLimit()` (only available when called `client.GetStreamsMetadata()`)
- `Response.GetStreamsMetadataRateLimitRemaining()` (only available when called `client.GetStreamsMetadata()`)

This package also allows users to provide a rate limit callback of their own which will be executed just before a request is sent. That way you can provide some sort of functionality for limiting the requests sent and prevent spamming Twitch with requests.

The below snippet provides an example of how you might structure your rate limit callback to approach limiting requests. In this example, once we've reached our rate limit, we'll simply wait for the limit to pass before sending the next request.

```go
func rateLimitCallback(lastResponse *helix.Response) error {
    if lastResponse.GetRateLimitRemaining() > 0 {
        return nil
    }

    var reset64 int64
    reset64 = int64(lastResponse.GetRateLimitReset())

    currentTime := time.Now().Unix()

    if currentTime < reset64 {
        timeDiff := time.Duration(reset64 - currentTime)
        if timeDiff > 0 {
            fmt.Printf("Waiting on rate limit to pass before sending next request (%d seconds)\n", timeDiff)
            time.Sleep(timeDiff * time.Second)
        }
    }

    return nil
}

client, err := helix.NewClient(&helix.Options{
    ClientID:      "your-client-id",
    RateLimitFunc: rateLimitCallback,
})
if err != nil {
    // handle error
}
```

If a `RateLimitFunc` is provided, the client will re-attempt to send a failed request if said request received a 429 (Too Many Requests) response. Before retrying the request, the `RateLimitFunc` will be applied.

## Access Tokens

Some API endpoints require that you have a valid access token in order to fulfill the request. There are two types of access tokens: app access tokens and user access tokens.

App access tokens allow game developers to integrate their game into Twitch's viewing experience. [Drops](https://dev.twitch.tv/drops) are an example of this.

User access tokens, on the other hand, are used to interact with the Twitch API on behalf of a registered Twitch user. If you're only looking to consume the standard API, such as getting access to a user's registered email address, user access tokens are what you will need.

It is worth noting that both app and user access tokens have the ability to extend the request rate limit enforced by Twitch. However, if you provide both an app and a user token - as is the case in the below example - the app access token will be ignored as user access tokens are prioritized when setting the request _Authorization_ header.

In order to set the access token for a request, you can either supply it as an option or use the `SetUserAccessToken` or `SetAppAccessToken` methods. For example:

```go
client, err := helix.NewClient(&helix.Options{
    ClientID:        "your-client-id",
    UserAccessToken: "your-user-access-token",
    AppAccessToken:  "your-app-access-token"
})
if err != nil {
    // handle error
}

// send API request...
```

Or:

```go
client, err := helix.NewClient(&helix.Options{
    ClientID: "your-client-id",
})
if err != nil {
    // handle error
}

client.SetUserAccessToken("your-user-access-token")
client.SetAppAccessToken("your-app-access-token")

// send API request...
```

Note that any subsequent API requests will utilize this same access token. So it is necessary to unset the access token when you are finished with it. To do so, simply pass an empty string to the `SetUserAccessToken` or `SetAppAccessToken` methods.

## User-Agent Header

It's entirely possible that you may want to set or change the *User-Agent* header value that is sent with each request. You can do so by passing it through as an option when creating a new client, like so:

with the `SetUserAgent()` method before sending a request. For example:

```go
client, err := helix.NewClient(&helix.Options{
    ClientID:  "your-client-id",
    UserAgent: "your-user-agent-value",
})
if err != nil {
    // handle error
}


// send API request...
```

Alternatively, you can set by calling the `SetUserAgent()` method before sending a request. For example:

```go
client, err := helix.NewClient(&helix.Options{
    ClientID:  "your-client-id",
})
if err != nil {
    // handle error
}

client.SetUserAgent("your-user-agent-value")

// send API request...
```

# Logging

## Adding a custom logger

You can add a custom logger to the client that will be used to print outgoing requests and incoming responses. Debug
mode must be set to `true` to enable logging.

This is an example of how to enable logging and log to a file:

```go
// Create a logger, which outputs to file.
f, err := os.OpenFile("log.txt", os.O_RDWR | os.O_CREATE | os.O_APPEND, 0666)
if err != nil {
    log.Fatalf("error opening file: %v", err)
}
defer f.Close()

fileLogger := &log.Logger{}
fileLogger.SetOutput(f)

client, err := helix.NewClient(&helix.Options{
    logger: fileLogger,	
    debug: true,	
})
if err != nil {
    log.Fatalf("error opening file: %v", err)

}
```

Should you want to enable debug mode but not want to use a custom logger, stdout will be used as the default log output.
